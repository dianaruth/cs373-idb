Mon Calamari was the name given to the planet by Human explorers from the Galactic Republic who first discovered and revealed the world to the rest of the galaxy. The native species referred to the planet as Dac. The planet was a shining bluish-white orb from space, due to its ocean-covered surface. It was home to 27.5 billion Mon Calamarians and Quarren, as well as surrounded by the impressive Mon Calamari Shipyards. In 137 ABY, all life on the planet was wiped out in accordance with the Final Protocol ordered by Darth Wyyrlok of the One Sith with the use of Viral spores to punish the Mon Calamari for rendering aid to the remnants of the Galactic Alliance. Nearly 20% of the planet's population was saved during the Evacuation of Dac.",
